ProjectDemiurge Software involves training a **Convolutional Neural Network** (called **UNET**) to to learn a new concept (someone's face). In this NOTEBOOK, we'll work through setting up **Xception** (a **Convolutional Neural Network**) and training the model to classify images of
flowers on Google's lightning-fast Cloud TPUs. Our model will take as input a photo of a flower and return whether it is a daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, or tulip. This notebook training is not necessary to use the ProjectDemiurge Software and serves as a more advanced training. 

We use the Keras framework, new to TPUs in TF 2.1.0.
